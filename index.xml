      <title>The joys of C API design: stripping whitespace from C-strings</title>
      <link>https://bool3max.win/posts/c_strip_whitespace/</link>

      <description>Suppose you are tasked with stripping leading and trailing whitespace from a string. In dynamic, garbage-collected languages whose standard libraries are usually equipped with functions that handle this, you don&amp;rsquo;t even think about the implementation. In Python (whose strings are immutable), you&amp;rsquo;d simply call the string&amp;rsquo;s .strip() method and get a stripped string back. In Golang, you&amp;rsquo;d call strings.TrimSpaces() and receive a new, stripped slice of the string.
While designing such a function in C (where you are required to manually manage memory) isn&amp;rsquo;t difficult - it can be done in a seemingly myriad of ways.</description>

      <title>A HashMap speedup tale: The number of allocations matters</title>

      <description>I recently wrote bhashmap - a C11 hash table implementation library. This post will document one of the latest optimizations, which is in hindsight extremely simple to understand and implement, but which resulted in a ~30% runtime speedup.
Background Before talking about the optimization, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly get up to speed with how things worked before. I will focus only on the details relevant to this particular optimization.
At the core of every hash table implementation is a key-value pair, and here the case is no different: every such pair is represented by a HashPair struct:</description>

      <title>How is time.sleep implemented in CPython?</title>

      <guid>https://bool3max.win/posts/time_sleep_cpython_implementation/</guid>
      <description>I recently got curious as to how the time.sleep function from Python&amp;rsquo;s standard library was implemented by CPython - and as it turns out, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to figure out.
All I had to do was strace a minimal example Python program that utlizies the function:
strace python3 -c &amp;#39;from time import sleep; sleep(0.5); print(&amp;#34;Done!&amp;#34;);&amp;#39; 2&amp;gt; out.txt And sure enough, near the very end of strace&amp;rsquo;s output, we see the following system call:</description>

      <title>Techniques for directly modifying bitfields of various datatypes in C</title>
      <link>https://bool3max.win/posts/modifying_bitfields_of_datatypes/</link>

      <description>Suppose that you are learning about IEEE-754 and you are experimenting with how single-precision values are encoded in memory. Suppose also that you are experimenting with various bitstring representations of floatint point values, and you wish to store one of them in C&amp;rsquo;s float datatype. Your first thought might be to do something like this:
const float num = 0b11000000000000000000001000000000; printf(&amp;#34;%.15f\n&amp;#34;, num); The bitstring constant used above represents the value -2.</description>

      <description>Modern 64-bit processors are capable of storing $2^{64}$ different values within their general-purpose registers. Each one of those possible values is simply a different combination of 64 sequential bits - and each one of those bits can, of course, exist in one of two states at a single point in time.
Given any number of bits $ N $, we can always conclude that the maximum number of different values representable using that particular bit count is always $ 2^N $.</description>

      <title>How does &#39;man&#39; actually display the pages?</title>
      <link>https://bool3max.win/posts/man_and_pagers_plus_colors/</link>

      <guid>https://bool3max.win/posts/man_and_pagers_plus_colors/</guid>
      <description>When you normally execute, say man 3 printf, man simply does the job of looking up and fetching the particular manpage. The actual act of displaying it, is done by a pager.
The default pager that man uses, less, is in essence a simple TUI program that allows for easy navigation of a particular text buffer (scrolling, searching, etc&amp;hellip; all using vi-like keybindings). It can output stylized text (bolds, underlines, etc&amp;hellip;) which it does by default for manpages.</description>

      <description>kill Despite its name (that it&amp;rsquo;s gotten from its most popular usecase), kill is very versatile tool used to send specified signals to individual processes, or process groups.
It is part of the util-linux collection of programs and is widely available.
Here area a couple of usage examples. If no signal name/number is specified, SIGTERM (15) is assumed:
kill firefox: Send a SIGTERM (15) signal to every process invoked as &#39;firefox&#39;.</description>

      <guid>https://bool3max.win/posts/sway_screenshare_guide/</guid>
      <description>I spent some time trying to get things to work and in the end I decided to compile the instructions in a compact and coherent guide.
Install Chromium 81.0.4044.122 or later, or Firefox 84.0-1 or later. Install pipewire, and if you&amp;rsquo;re using Chromium, libpipewire02 as well. If you&amp;rsquo;re using Arch, both packages are available in the official repositories. Install xdg-desktop-portal-wlr. It is available in the official Arch repositories. If you&amp;rsquo;re running Firefox, make sure that MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 is set before you start it to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s running natively.</description>

      <title>UTF-8</title>
      <link>https://bool3max.win/posts/utf8/</link>

      <description>As of writing, Unicode contains 1,112,064 possible codepoints.
Actual codepoints range from 0 through 0x10FFFF though a part is reserved for backwards compatibility of other codecs with UTF-16, resulting in 1,112,064 actually available codepoints.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that not all (in fact most) codepoints are not characters. A common example is the Combining Diaeresis (e.g. ï) or the &amp;ldquo;double dot above&amp;rdquo; mark that, when rendered, simply appears above the adjecent previous character.</description>

      <title>Parallelism and Concurrency: The basics</title>

      <description>This post documents my understanding of the basics regarding concurrency and parallelism and their manifestation in operating systems.
Definitions Before I begin I want to define what exactly parallelism and concurrency are. However as it turns out, this isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly set in stone, and the definitions are somewhat convoluted.
The StackOverlfow question (What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?) in particular has quite a number of somewhat conflicting answers, which is understandable, since if someone asked me what the difference between the two terms are - I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to answer.</description>

      <title>The basics of operations on Pipes/FIFOs on Linux</title>
      <link>https://bool3max.win/posts/semantics_of_linux_fifo_operations/</link>

      <guid>https://bool3max.win/posts/semantics_of_linux_fifo_operations/</guid>
      <description>This post summarizes behavior of different operations on Pipe/FIFO files on linux and is to serve as a future reference. It may or may not go particularly in-depth on the subject, it depends.
All of this information is available in the fifo(7) and pipe(7) manpages.
Opening FIFOs opening a FIFO for reading will block until it is also open for writing on another end opening a FIFO for writing will block until it is also open for reading on the another end (same rules) opening a FIFO for reading and writing (O_RDWR) will always succeed, though this behavior is undefined by POSIX this is the only way to open a FIFO on the writing end which has not yet been opened on the reading end O_NONBLOCK (non-blocking mode) opening for read-only + the FIFO hasn&amp;rsquo;t been opened on the writing end the call immediately succeeds even if the FIFO is not yet open on the writing end opening for write-only + the FIFO hasn&amp;rsquo;t been opened on the reading end the call immediately fails with the error ENXIO (no such device or address), unless, of course, the file is already opened for reading on the other end Reading and writing The read/write semantics are exactly the same for pipes and FIFOs.</description>

      <title>Context Managers and the &#39;with&#39; keyword in Python3</title>
      <link>https://bool3max.win/posts/context_managers_and_with_python3/</link>

      <guid>https://bool3max.win/posts/context_managers_and_with_python3/</guid>
      <description>Context Managers in python3 are a simple but powerful feature.
The most common example of a context-manager in action is opening a file and not having to worry about manually closing it later on, and instead letting the context manager implementation (in this case the open function) do the work for you:
with open(&amp;#34;file&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;rb&amp;#34;) as file: ... Instead of having to manually call file.close() later on, once the &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo; block ends, the appropriate cleanup actions (in this case flushing the file to disk and closing the file descriptors) are automatically performed.</description>

      <title>Briefly explaining Python3 Decorators</title>

      <description>Decorators are a way to modify behavior of functions using other functions.
Take a look at the following routine:
def sum(x, y): return x + y Say we wanted to alter this function so that it would always return a result by 1 larger than the sum. We can write a decorator for that:
def increment(func): def add_one(x, y): return func(x, y) + 1 return add_one @increment def sum(x, y): return x + y &amp;gt; sum(5, 4) 10 Under the hood, sum becomes increment(sum), i.</description>

      <description>Recently I needed a way to infinitely loop over a list in Python. Traditionally, this is extremely easy to do with simple indexing if the size of the list is known in advance. For example, an approach could look something like this:
l = [1, 2, 3] i = 0 while True: print(l[i]) i += 1 if i == len(l): i = 0 Eventually I settled on a an inbuilt approach using the itertools module from the standard library.</description>

      <description>Python is a programming language. It is nothing more but one large document of text and code examples (a standard) that describes exactly how the language is to behave. You can&amp;rsquo;t run it, download it, or execute it. That&amp;rsquo;s it, it&amp;rsquo;s just text.
The latest edition of it is up on the official Python website as the The Python Language Reference. As Python also consists of a standard library of functions, a document that describes how the modules and their respective functions are to behave is also readily available as The Python Standard Library.</description>

      <title>Why I prefer fish over bash for scripting</title>
      <link>https://bool3max.win/posts/fish_scripting_over_bash/</link>

      <description>Scripting with fish is simple. It is readable. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to have deep experience with it in order to understand the syntax.
Compared to bash, it feels intuitive.
Everything is a builtin builtins are commands that you call from the shell, but unlike regular commands that execute external binaries and spawn new processes, they are built right into the shell (e.g. echo, math, set, count).
The core syntax of fish is very simple, and most all of the operations are done via calling builtins.</description>

      <description>I recently took it upon myself to, at least at the surface level, understand how the ELF (&amp;quot;Executable and Linkable Format&amp;quot;) works. In order to do that, I set out to create a tiny python3 module for parsing (meta-)data out of ELF files.
The result of that is p3elf, during the development of which I familiarized myself with ELF, binary IO in python, as well as setuptools and publishing python packages on PyPI.</description>

      <description>This document serves as a quick reference to how UEFI and GPT work in regards to booting a modern system.
I will not cover BIOS/MBR in this document. I will acknowledge their existence and will compare them to their modern counterparts, but I feel that it is a waste of time to dig deeper into their inner workings. I will also not cover or mention the compatibility possibilites/issues of using UEFI/MBR or BIOS/GPT.</description>

      <title>Type Conversion and Declarations in C</title>

      <guid>https://bool3max.win/posts/c_tc_and_decl/</guid>
      <description>This document explains the rules of type conversion, declarations, as well as object properties described in the C standard. It is not meant to be read as a tutorial, but rather as a quick reference.
Type Conversion Implicit conversion - conversion done automatically by the compiler (no casts) - assignment conversion, or usual arithmetic conversion &amp;ndash; RULES:
integer ranks (excluding extended and enumerated types): long long int, unsigned long long int long int, unsigned long int int, unsigned int short int, unsigned short int char, singed char, unsigned char _Bool integer promotion: an operation that converts any type whose rank is less than int or unsigned int to int (provided it can fit) or else unsigned int Usual arithmetic conversion &amp;ndash; conversion done upon non-equivalent types of operands with binary operators, or perhaps mismatch return type from a function or a function parameter/argument: either operand is floating type: float -&amp;gt; double -&amp;gt; long double convert the other operand to the same floating type neither operand is a floating type: First, perform integer promotion on both operands If types of both operands are now the same, the process ends, if not, perform the following rules, and stop at the first one that applies If both operands have signed types or if both operands have unsigned types, convert the operand whose type rank is lower to the type of the operand whose type rank is higher If the operand with the unsigned type has a rank HIGHER or EQUAL to the rank of the signed operand, convert the operand with the singed type to the type of the operand with the unsigned type If the operand with the signed type can represent all of the values of the type with the unsigned operand, convert the unsigned operand to the type of the signed operand If none of the above rules apply, convert BOTH operands to the unsigned &amp;ldquo;version&amp;rdquo; of the type of the signed operand Assignment conversion: The usual arithmetic conversion rules do not apply here.</description>

      <description>This is a pretty old document that I wrote for myself back when I was first learning C, but the explanation is pretty good so I published it here for future reference. I hope to soon push a reference document that explains some tricky concepts and things from the C standard that are not so easy to remember off the top of the head (such as type conversion, declarations, storage durations, scopes, etc&amp;hellip;)</description>
