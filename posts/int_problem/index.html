<p>This is a pretty old document that I wrote for myself back when I was first learning C, but the explanation is pretty good so I published it here for future reference. I hope to soon push a reference document that explains some tricky concepts and things from the C standard that are not so easy to remember off the top of the head (such as type conversion, declarations, storage durations, scopes, etc&hellip;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For future reference, always refer to the latest C standard as it has answers to many questions of the same nature such as this one. The C11 draft can be found <a href="https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, I posted <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51160300/why-do-c-compilers-not-warn-when-assigning-integer-value-too-high-for-signed-typ?noredirect=1#comment89304841_51160300">this question to StackOverflow</a> about the following program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">int</span> <span style="color:#666;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">main</span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">void</span>) {
    <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">int</span> n = 0xFFFFFFFF;
    printf(<span style="color:#666;font-style:italic">&#34;%d</span><span style="color:#666;font-style:italic">\n</span><span style="color:#666;font-style:italic">&#34;</span>, n); <span style="color:#888;font-style:italic">//was originaly %u
</span><span style="color:#888;font-style:italic"></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>In this explanation, I will disregard the fact that I used the wrong conversion specifier in my <code>printf</code> call (used <code>%u</code> instead of <code>%d</code>), thus I will replace it with the correct one, and will come back to the topic of <code>%u</code> later on in the explanation.</p>
<p>So, what exactly is happening here? Initially, I was confused as to why this program&rsquo;s output was <code>-1</code> (at least on a linux/gcc 64bit platform).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; down into pieces and analyze each statement and operand separately:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The hexadecimal constant <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code>, is in decimal form equal to <code>2 ^ 32 - 1</code>, or <code>4294967295</code>, and in binary form, equal to <code>11111111111111111111111111111111</code>. By the compiler, <strong>it is treated as an <em>unsigned integer</em></strong>, and not as a series of bits. Yes, it can be represented as a series of 32 bits <em>(all 1&rsquo;s)</em>, but to the compiler that is apparently irrelevant. In C99, hexadecimal and octal constants are tested in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>int</li>
<li>unsigned int</li>
<li>long int</li>
<li>unsigned long int</li>
<li>long long int</li>
<li>unsigned long long int</li>
</ul>
<p>The first type that is large enough to accomodate the size of the constant is the one that the compiler will use to identify it.
In this case, <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code> is too large to fit in the first contender (<code>int</code>, or rather <code>signed int</code>), but is just the right size to be treated as an <code>unsigned int</code>, and thus the compiler treats it as that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s look at the left operand of the <code>=</code> operator, <code>int</code>. When used by itself, it is the equivalent of <code>singed int</code>, and thus I will refer to it as that from now on. The largest positive number that a <code>signed int</code> can store is equal to <code>2 ^ 31 - 1</code>, or <code>2147483647</code> in decimal form, due to the need of being able to represent negative integers, and thus having one less bit to work with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The types of the operands on both sides of the <code>=</code> operator <strong>don&rsquo;t match</strong>. One is a <code>signed int</code>, the other an <code>unsigned int</code>. Thus, C has to <em>implicitly</em> convert the right operant <em>to the type of the left operand</em>. (in assignment, <strong>the right operand always has to abide by the type of the left one</strong>). The result of this conversion isn&rsquo;t specified in the C standard, and is therefore implemenation defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per my current understanding, the binary representation of <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code>, or rather <code>0b11111111111111111111111111111111</code> is simply copied into the address of our <code>signed int n</code> varible. Since the variable is a <code>signed integer</code>, it utilizes <strong>2&rsquo;s complement</strong>. In 2&rsquo;s complement, a binary representation of <strong>all 1s</strong> is always equal to <em><strong>-1</strong></em> in decimal form, and therefore <em><strong>that is the output of our printf() call</strong></em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are all 1s always equal to -1 (decimal) in 2&rsquo;s complement? Let&rsquo;s look at the following example using an 8bit number (although the same rules apply for any other number of bits, <em>including 32</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>in a regular unsigned system, 1 (decimal) is equal to <code>0b00000001</code> in binary. Very obvious.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s get the negative value of this number (-1) using the 2s complement operation:
<ul>
<li>first we invert the bits: <code>0b00000001</code> -&gt; <code>0b11111110</code></li>
<li>then we add 1        : <code>0b11111110</code> -&gt; <code>0b11111111</code>.</li>
<li>Upon completion of the 2s complement operation, we ended up with a binary representation of the negative version of our original number (-1)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As you can see, we&rsquo;ve ended up with the number -1 (decimal), that is in binary equal to all 1s (all bits). The same is true when the operation is applied to a number consisting of any number of bits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-u-problem">The <code>%u</code> problem</h2>
<p>As I said, in my original question I (for some unknown reason?) substituted the <code>%d</code> conversion specifier with the <code>%u</code> conversion specifier, resulting in the following statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">printf(<span style="color:#666;font-style:italic">&#34;%u</span><span style="color:#666;font-style:italic">\n</span><span style="color:#666;font-style:italic">&#34;</span>, n);
</code></pre></div><p>This statement prints out <code>4294967295</code>. Why? Let&rsquo;s find out:</p>
<p>The <code>%u</code> conversion expects an unsigned integer as the argument. We&rsquo;ve, however, supplied it a <em>singed</em> integer. However, this time there is no conversion, as the conversion from <code>int</code> to <code>unsigned int</code> is impossible, nonexistent, and therefore the behaviour is undefined.</p>
<p>In the case of GCC, <code>%u</code> (or rather, <code>printf</code>) <em>assumes</em> that the value passed to it is of the correct type (<code>uint</code> in this case), and prints its value accordingly. <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code> in an unsigned system has the decimal value <em>4294967295</em>, which is then simply printed.</p>
