<h1 id="definitions">Definitions</h1>
<p>Before I begin I want to define what exactly parallelism and concurrency are. However as it turns out, this isn&rsquo;t exactly set in stone, and the definitions are somewhat convoluted.</p>
<p>The StackOverlfow question (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/what-is-the-difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism">What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?</a>) in particular has quite a number of somewhat conflicting answers, which is understandable, since if someone asked me what the difference between the two terms are - I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to answer. To me, both of them share the meaning of &ldquo;doing multiple things at the same time&rdquo;. In fact, the dictionary definitions share very similar meanings as well.</p>
<p>To cut the whole story short, I will choose two widely accepted definitions and abide by them from now on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concurrency</strong> is the ability of a system that allows multiple tasks to run in overlapping time periods. There is never more than one task executing at a single point in time, instead the system &ldquo;juggles&rdquo; between tasks as needed. This gives us the <em>illusion</em> of parallelism - an example of which is multitasking on a single-core CPU.
<ul>
<li>Also: Concurrency: A condition that exists when, during a given period of time, multiple threads (&ldquo;multiple tasks&rdquo; in the general sense) are making progress. Doesn&rsquo;t mean that they were ever both executing at the same single point in time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Parallelism</strong> is the ability of a system that allows multiple tasks to run <strong>simultaneously</strong>. They are <em>truly</em> running <em>at the same time</em>.
<ul>
<li>Also: Parallelism: A condition that arises when, given a particular point in time, multiple threads (&ldquo;multiple tasks&rdquo;) are executing simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many metaphors that can be applied to more easily explain the aforementioned definitions, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concurrency</strong> is a single ATM serving a line of people over the course of an hour.</li>
<li><strong>Parallelism</strong> is two ATMs serving two lines of people at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/24684037/5447136">this</a> excellent answer with more real-world examples.</p>
<h1 id="linux">Linux</h1>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve established what parallelism and concurrency are - how do they manifest themselves in real world environments, or rather operating systems?</p>
<p>First it&rsquo;s important to realize that modern CPUs achieve parallelism via the use of multiple physical cores.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To avoid the confusion in the following parts of this document I&rsquo;ll get this out of the way right now: &ldquo;<strong>physical threads</strong>&rdquo; that you hear about in the context of &ldquo;the new Intel CPU has 8 cores and 16 threads&rdquo; are different to &ldquo;<strong>logical threads</strong>&rdquo; (or software threads) that I&rsquo;ll talk about shortly. This confusion has been a slight obstacle in my early research of the topic and I really wish that they didn&rsquo;t share the name, despite both of them being related to concurrency/parallelism. Also, I&rsquo;ll talk about most of the software concepts as they relate to linux, however a large portion of semantics are shared between modern OSs, especially Unix derivatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each core executes instructions independent of the others and it also has its own registers and cache. That&rsquo;s why some resources even refer to physical cores simply as CPUs.</p>
<p>Under Linux (and other modern OSs) there are a couple key concepts (features?) that heavily relate to concurrency and parallelism and that I&rsquo;ll try to explain:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="processes"><strong>Processes</strong>:</h3>
<p>Processes represent &ldquo;running programs&rdquo; (flows of execution, tasks) on the system. Each process has an ID (PID) and an associated PPID (parent process ID).</p>
<p>Processes cannot share memory between each other (be that the stack or the heap).</p>
<p>They are composed of one or more (one by default) &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; flows of execution called <strong>threads</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="threads"><strong>Threads</strong>:</h3>
<p>Every spawned process contains one thread by default. All threads belonging to a process share the same heap memory, but each one has its own stack. They are lighter to start-up than processes since there is less initialization involved (namely the fact that they shared the same virutal address space so a new one doesn&rsquo;t have to be created each time).</p>
<p>The most prevelant standard for threading is the <strong>pthreads</strong> (<strong>POSIX Threads</strong>) specification. In Linux it is implemented using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_POSIX_Thread_Library">NPTL (Native POSIX Thread Library)</a> library, which was a standalone project for some time after its creation, but is a part of <strong><code>glibc</code></strong> now.</p>
