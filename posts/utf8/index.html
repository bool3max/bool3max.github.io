			<p>As of writing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> contains <strong>1,112,064</strong> possible codepoints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actual codepoints range from 0 through 0x10FFFF though a part is reserved for backwards compatibility of other codecs with UTF-16, resulting in <strong>1,112,064</strong> actually available codepoints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that not all (in fact most) <strong>codepoints</strong> are not <strong>characters</strong>. A common example is the <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/0308/">Combining Diaeresis (e.g. ï)</a> or the &ldquo;double dot above&rdquo; mark that, when rendered, simply appears above the adjecent previous character. In fact I can&rsquo;t even paste it in <code>neovim</code> on its own, it simply appears above the previously typed character.</p>

<h1 id="utf-8">UTF-8</h1>
<p>UTF-8 is a <em>variable</em> Unicode encoding in a sense that not all codepoints occupy the same amount of bytes in their encoded form. This is different from, for example, <strong>UTF-32</strong> where every single codepoint always occupies exactly 4 bytes. This makes it very easy to parse but it also makes it very memory inefficient. Back to UTF-8, the maximum number of bytes an encoded codepoint can occupy is 4, even though only <strong>21</strong> bits are required to represent all possible codepoints, and we&rsquo;ll see why shortly.</p>

<p>These rules made little sense to me at the beginning. However, as I read more and more of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">Wikipedia article on UTF-8</a> things became clearer. For example, all codepoints between U+0000 and U+007F ooccupy exactly one byte and that byte cannot be larger than 127 (0x7F) in order to maintain complete interchangeability with US-ASCII. If we encounter a single byte &lt;= 0x7F, we know that it&rsquo;s a single byte codepoint and an ASCII character. (though <code>(byte &amp; 0x80) == 0</code> is a more portable check if we&rsquo;re also dealing with signed types)</p>
<p>The restrictions for the 3 following codepoint ranges exist for similar reasons (mainly UTF-16 compatibility I think, but I&rsquo;m not too sure on these), for example, for all codepoints between 0x800 and 0xFFFF, 3 bytes are required even though all numbers in that range can fit into 2 bytes, since 5 bits in the 2byte form are reserved.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how the euro sign (€) is encoded in UTF-8.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Unicode codepoint of the euro sign is <strong>U+20AC</strong>. If we look at the table above, we see that it falls between codepoint <strong>U+0800</strong> and codepoint <strong>U+FFFF</strong>, meaning that it <strong>takes 3 bytes to encode in memory</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>0x20AC</strong> in binary are the two bytes: <code>0b00100000</code> and <code>0b10101100</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Byte by byte we &ldquo;replace&rdquo; all the available bytes from the sequence in the table by the bytes from the codepoint. If you look at the table, you can see that for codepoints that take 3 bytes to encode, we have exactly 16 bits (2 bytes) available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we replace them, we get: <code>0b11100010</code>, <code>0b10000010</code> and <code>0b10101100</code>, or in hex: <code>0xE2</code>, <code>0x82</code>, <code>0xAC</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From our shell we can see that this is exactly how the € is encoded:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>echo -n &quot;€&quot; | xxd -g 1 -c 10 -u
00000000: E2 82 AC                       ...
</code></pre><h1 id="writing-an-utf-8-decoder">Writing an UTF-8 decoder</h1>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for a long time just because of how vital a part UTF-8 plays, well, everywhere. Literally all text that you see nowadays on screen was at some point encoded as UTF-8, then decoded to get all invididual codepoints, and then rendered to the screen with a relevant font.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>String related functions in C&rsquo;s stdlib pay no attention to any sort of encoding at all. They follow the &lsquo;1 byte = 1 character&rsquo; mantra. Support for different encodings exists via <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/wide">Wide strings</a> and <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/multibyte">Multi-byte strings</a> but I&rsquo;ve never had a reason to use those functions. They are also very intertwined with the C locale, which is also a very complicated topic as evident by the infamous <a href="https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/1e70e82baa9193f6f027338b0fab0f5078971fbe">mpv developer C locale rant</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing a <em>decoder</em> turned out to be way easier than I thought. The gist of basically the entire operation is the following: peek at the first byte of the string -&gt; find out how many bytes the codepoint that it&rsquo;s a part of occupies -&gt; construct a codepoint from those bytes -&gt; seek that many bytes forward in the stream -&gt; return. Repeat for the entire string.</p>
<p>The only part I struggled with for a bit was the bitwise manipulation regarding specific bytes as I had little experience with that prior to this project - that is now <a href="https://github.com/bool3max/butf8">on GitHub as <strong>butf8</strong></a>. In the future I&rsquo;m planning to add encoding as well as indexing support and error checking - all of which should be fairly trivial.</p>
