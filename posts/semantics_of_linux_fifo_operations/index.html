		<section class="body">
			<p>This post summarizes behavior of different operations on FIFO files on linux and is to serve as a future reference. It may or may not go particularly in-depth on the subject, it depends.</p>
<p>All of this information is available in the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/7/fifo"><code>fifo(7)</code></a> and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/7/pipe"><code>pipe(7)</code></a> manpages.</p>
<h1 id="opening">Opening</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>opening a FIFO for reading will block until it is also open for writing on the other end (&ldquo;other end&rdquo; here meaning inside another process or another thread in the same process).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opening a FIFO for writing will block until it is also open for reading on the other end (same rules apply).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opening a FIFO for reading <em>and</em> writing (<code>O_RDWR</code>) will <em>always</em> succeed, though this behavior is undefined by POSIX so I think I&rsquo;ll skip using it.</p>
<ul>
<li>this is the only way to open a FIFO on the writing end which has not yet been opened on the reading end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="o_nonblock-non-blocking-mode"><code>O_NONBLOCK</code> (non-blocking mode)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>read-only</p>
<ul>
<li>the call immediately succeeds even if the FIFO is not yet open on the writing end</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>write-only</p>
<ul>
<li>the call immediately fails with the error <code>ENXIO</code> (no such device or address), unless, of course, the file is already opened for reading on the other end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="reading-and-writing">Reading and writing</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>attempting to read from a FIFO that has no data inside of it, but that has an open writer end will result in the <code>read()</code> call blocking until data is available, <strong>UNLESS</strong> the reader end was opened in non-blocking mode (<code>O_NONBLOCK</code>), in which case the <code>read()</code> call will return EOF (<strong><code>0</code></strong>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attempting to read from a FIFO that has no open writer ends will result in the <code>read()</code> call immediately returning EOF (<strong><code>0</code></strong>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attempting to write to a FIFO which is not open on the read end will result in the process being sent a <strong><code>SIGPIPE</code></strong> signal (the default action for which is TERM, i.e. to terminate the process)</p>
<ul>
<li>if the calling process is ignoring this signal, <code>write()</code> will instead immediately fail with the error <code>EPIPE</code></li>
<li>again, this can happen when a FIFO has been properly opened for writing, but the reading end had since been closed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
